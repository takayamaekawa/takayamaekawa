## Who am I?

Hey, I’m verazza — a developer who thrives in the terminal.  
I don't use VSCode ❌. I live and breathe Neovim 💨.  
If it runs on the command line, I’m into it.

### Interests

- 🛠 Building tools with a hacker mindset  
- ⚡ Speed-focused workflows with dotfiles, tmux, and Neovim  
- 🔥 Exploring systems, from Arch Linux to WSL  
- 🧪 Experimenting with Scala, React, and Minecraft plugin development  

### Featured Projects

- [`nvim`](https://github.com/verazza/nvim): My custom Neovim setup — minimal, fast, and battle-tested  
- [`devkit`](https://github.com/verazza/devkit): A reproducible, containerized dev environment for WSL  
- [`kishax`](https://github.com/verazza/kishax): Start a server. Create wild images. All with kishax — Minecraft scripting made fun.
